Mouse Macros

A modifier key (hard-coded capslock for now) locks mouse movement and the scroll wheel. This allows me to record the mouse movement to perform special inputs like a fighting game. 

There are 20 commands tied to "soft" rolls and 4 tied to "hard" rolls.
The 20 inputs are a cardinal direction attached to another "action." These actions are:
releasing the modifier key, left click, right click, mousewheel up, and mousewheel down.
